## ✨ About The Design

We believe that a tool for building portfolios should itself be a showcase of modern web design. The frontend is built to be:

*   **⚡ Reactive & Fluid:** Powered by **Framer Motion**, every transition, hover state, and page load is animated to provide a premium feel.
*   **💎 Glassmorphism Aesthetic:** We utilize modern CSS techniques like backdrop-filters, translucent layers, and vibrant gradients to create a depth-rich interface.
*   **📱 Adaptive Layouts:** The UI adapts intelligently to any screen size, ensuring the generator is usable on mobile phones and large desktop monitors alike.
*   **🧩 Component-Driven:** Built using a modular component architecture for maintainability and scalability.

## 🚀 Features

- **💅 Beautiful UI:** Styled with **TailwindCSS** and **Bootstrap** for a polished, modern look.
